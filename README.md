# Hacker Rank Exercises

This repo contains all the exercises I do on Hacker Rank

**Note**: Every exercise has its owned set of instructions inside the package, so feel free to read it.

**Disclaimer**: Every exercise is tested with Hacker Rank, and I create my tests to know if everything works, so let me know if something is wrong.
